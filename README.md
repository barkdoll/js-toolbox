# Jesse's libs

A bank of various portable and reusable code chunks I have collected, modified, and implemented during my development journey. 

I can't take credit for most of it, and portable code is meant to be reused, so feel free to steal what you need, and take what you like!

## What are helpers?

Derived from the naming convention of the famous PHP Framework [CodeIgniter](https://www.codeigniter.com/), helpers are extensions of a programming language that provide extra functionality to its built-in data types. 

For example, in JavaScript I have created methods on the prototype of various data types such as `String`, `RegExp`, `Array`, and `Object`.

### Helpers vs. Libraries
The difference between helpers and libraries is that helpers should not require any other dependenciesâ€” they only use what is already built into the programming language.
